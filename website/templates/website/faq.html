                                    This is an ever-evolving complex question. The answer will depend largely on who
                                    you ask and when you ask. The question is complex both because of the
                                    interdisciplinary
                                    nature of HCI as well as the different threads of research within it (<i>e.g.,</i>
                                    from more usability-leaning research to more design-oriented research). Skills/areas
                                    that I consider core to HCI can be broken down into seven interconnected areas (in
                                    no particular order):

                                    If you are a CS graduate student, I would try to take as many machine learning,
                                    statistics, and computer vision courses as possible. Whether CSE, HCDE, or iSchool,
                                    I would
                                    try to take at least an "Intro to HCI" course (if you have not as an undergrad),
                                    a graphic design or interaction design (IxD) course, and a research methods course
                                    (the more, the better). I'll close my answer by emphasizing that I truly believe
                                    that the best way to learn is by doing. So, get out there and try!

                                    This is a good question. The answer, really, is that it depends on your
                                    skills/background, your research interests and goals, and who you want to work with.

                                    This is completely up to you but it is not necessary and somewhat atypical.

                                <p> You may want to apply to MS programs
                                    first to get a taste of research and to help decide if you want to pursue a
                                    research-oriented career and get a PhD. This is what I did. I enrolled at the
                                    University
                                    of California, Irvine as an MS student and worked with <a
                                            href="https://www.dourish.com/">Professor Paul Dourish</a> before
                                    applying to PhD programs and eventually attending the University of Washington.
                                    Note:
                                    most MS programs are professionally oriented rather than research oriented. So, be
                                    sure
                                    to investigate each program closely. No matter what university you attend, if you
                                    have
                                    ambitions to earn your doctorate, the most important thing is the kind of research
                                    you
                                    do during your MS, your research productivity during that time, and who you work

                                    (e.g., your MS advisor).

                                    research is heavily design/engineering but is also interdisciplinary. In particular,

                                    students in computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering to
                                    apply

                                        application form</a></strong>. Note that because it takes time and effort to onboard and mentor
                                        students into research, we ask for a minimum two-quarter commitment.

                                        Second, for qualified candidates, we will request a <strong>letter of
                                        recommendation</strong>.
                                        This letter can be brief—one or two paragraphs is fine—but
                                        should speak to your creativity, responsibility and maturity, drive, and
                                        technical skills. The letter should also identify key improvement areas.

                                        Finally, we will schedule a <strong>~20-30 min interview</strong> to help assess

                                        and technical skills/experiences.

                                    Top candidates will be offered a position on an active research project (typically led by a PhD student)
                                    —which will be based on the candidate's interests, skillsets, and the needs of our research. Candidates with
                                    less experience (e.g., first year ugrads, those without previous technical internships) may
                                    work with me on a side project first before joining a research team in earnest.
                                </p>
                                <p> Regardless,
                                    all new ugrad members will entire an initial 'trial period' of 5-10 weeks where we setup
                                    a mutually agreed upon set of initial tasks and milestones. At the end of the trial period,
                                    we will have an in-person meeting where we assess whether the student has met their commitments and is a good fit for our lab.
                                    Just as importantly, the student also reflects on whether they want to continue working with us.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After the trial period ends, successful students become core members of the Makeability Lab—get increased levels of
                                    responsibility, get added to the ML webpage, get a t-shirt :), etc.

                                    I have seen many undergraduate students fail at research simply because they vastly
                                    underestimated the amount of time and effort required to be successful. Research is
                                    hard.

                                    skills, on the projects we're working on, on the other undergraduates in the lab,
                                    and on the availability of graduate student mentors. Generally, all of my undergrads
                                    work on teams comprised of other students and faculty (in a range of
                                    disciplines), and are also mentored by one or two graduate students.

                                In any case, I truly believe—and have observed firsthand—that undergraduate students
                                can significantly and positively impact a research project.

                                    Taking these courses is a great way
                                    to free up your schedule for research (by reducing your lecture-based courseload)
                                    while also earning credit.

                                <p>While I am grateful to be in a position to receive such interest, it is simply not
                                    tenable to
                                    thoroughly
                                    vet each of these applications. Moreover, many of these students want to come to the
                                    US for only
                                    a short period
                                    (2 - 3 months). It would be challenging for even a 2nd or 3rd year graduate student
                                    with research experience to accomplish
                                    publishable research in that time (especially starting from zero) much less an
                                    undergraduate
                                    student with little research experience
                                    (not to mention the transactional costs of acclimating to a new lab, working with
                                    new people,
                                    adapting to a new culture). So, in
                                    short, I either do not respond to these requests directly (my apologies, I simply
                                    receive too
                                    many emails) or respond with a polite "No."

                                    I realize this means that I am likely missing out on working with and learning from
                                    some truly
                                    talented and exceptional students but
                                    the time and effort required to take such a risk outweighs the benefits for me (at
                                    least at this
                                    stage in my career).

                                    There has been only one exception to the above and that was for an extraordinary
                                    student whom I
                                    had previously met at a conference,
                                    had already first-authored a research paper published at a top venue, had incredible

                                Writing letters of recommendation is one of the most important aspects of my job
                                as a professor, and I gain a lot of satisfaction from helping students seek out
                                and reach new opportunities in their careers. With that said, writing a quality,
                                thoughtful recommendation letter takes time. When you ask for a recommendation letter,
                                it's important that you consider the effort that's required. You want to make the
                                process <em>as easy as possible</em> for me so that I can focus on the intellectual
                                effort of writing a good letter rather than the administrative effort of gathering
                                all the resources I need to write the letter, keeping track of where to send the
                                letters, and dealing with the idiosyncrasies of web-forms. So, to help us both,
                                when requesting a letter please...
                                <ol class="list">
                                    <li>Importantly, when you first ask if I would write you a letter, you should
                                        provide
                                        well-thought out rationale for why you're <em>asking me</em> and what you think
                                        I
                                        can speak about that may differentiate my letter from others. Note that I, of
                                        course,
                                        reserve the right to disagree with your rationale if I do not think that I would
                                        be a good choice for your rec letter. And that's fine--you need to find the best
                                        letter writers for you! It's your career and your life.

                                    <li>Ask for the letter <strong>in advance</strong>--a month
                                        beforehand
                                        would be nice. While I certainly do not need a month to write the letter, this
                                        lead
                                        time allows me to work around travel, big deadlines, etc., so that I can block
                                        out
                                        a free, quiet time to write a thoughtful and substantive letter. Please check
                                        with
                                        me a week before the recommendation letter deadline to ensure everything is
                                        going
                                        smoothly.

                                    My apologies! Thank you for your email—I look forward to talking with you! I
                                    really try to respond to nearly every email I receive (except for template emails
                                    from prospective students). However, sometimes my
                                    responses are delayed (by multiple days) or sometimes I simply miss your email.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you don't hear from me within two days, please don't hesitate to send me a
                                    follow-up email (or even two) that contains your original email plus a "ping" note
                                    or something similar (so that I realize this is an additional attempt to contact
                                    me).
                                    I know this is less than ideal (and, perhaps, even sounds a bit pretentious) but I
                                    have recently crossed the email inbox threshold where I am literally drowning in
                                    email. I've found that it's not possible for me to process all of
                                    these emails and get my other work done each day. Hence, I suggest simply pinging me
                                    again with a friendly follow-up if I don't respond to your original message. :)
