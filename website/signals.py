# A note about the @receiver decorator used in signals.py.
# There are two ways to hook up receiver functions
# 1. You can hook them up manually:
#     from django.core.signals import request_finished
#     request_finished.connect(my_callback)
#
# 2. You can use a receiver() decorator (the @receiver thing). This is the approach we are using.
#    In order for this to work, we must add in an import website.signals to the ready() function
#    in apps.py, which we've done.
